 * Normalizes the code's four main fields (type, code, version and id). The first three are considered to be

 * missing, or the version is set to '1' if it is the only missing authoritative field. The id is then rederived from
 * the three fields.
 * @param code The code to normalize.
 * @returns A shallow copy of the input with its type, code, version and id normalized.
